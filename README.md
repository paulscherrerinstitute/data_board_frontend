### üé® Adding Custom Themes

Adding a custom theme can be done by opening a PR with the following changes:

1.  **Define the Theme**

    - Create a new file in [`src/themes`](./src/themes) (e.g. `myCustomTheme.ts`)
    - Use [`base.ts`](./src/themes/base.ts) as a reference for structure.
    - If your theme includes a **custom watermark image**, add it to the [`src/media`](./src/media) folder.

2.  **Update the Theme Type**

    - Open [`src/themes/themes.types.ts`](./src/themes/themes.types.ts)
    - Add your new theme key to the `AvailableTheme` type:
        ```ts
        export type AvailableTheme = "default" | ... | "yourNewTheme";
        ```

3.  **Extend the `themes.ts` List**

    - Open [`src/themes/themes.ts`](./src/themes/themes.ts)
    - Add your new theme to the `themes` record:

        ````ts
        import myCustomTheme from "./myCustomTheme"; // Import your new theme

               export const themes: Record<AvailableTheme, { theme: ThemeOptions; displayName: string }> = {
                   default: {
                       theme: defaultTheme,
                       displayName: "Default",
                   },
                   ...,
                   myCustomTheme: {
                       theme: myCustomTheme,  // Add your theme here
                       displayName: "My Custom Theme",  // Set a display name for the theme, which will be displayed in settings
                   },
               };
               ```

          And just like that, your new theme should be selectable. Please test it thoroughly before opening the PR; Sometimes themes can have quite an impact on performance.
        ````

The watermark, which has to be defined in the theme, can be any file supported by [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/images/).

### üìñ FAQ

> **Q:** Nothing yet  
> **A:** All clear ;)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

> **Performance:** We are aware the website can be slow sometimes. This applies especially with many plots, plotting many curves with a lot of data points. To a certain extent this is natural, due to browser limitations. At the same time, the application could probably also be optimized a bit. If you can't stand the performance, feel free to optimize, and open a PR. If you have any groundbreaking ideas that could drastically improve performance (not rewriting in rust), at best with a little proof-of-concept, feel free to reach out to the current maintainer.
